						<p>Since 2011, all major desktop browsers began to support SVG.</p>
						
						<aside class="notes">
							SVG specification was developed back in 1999 by the World Wide Web Consortium.

					<h2>More about</h2>
					<h4>Icon font <span>and</span> Object</h4>

					<aside class="notes">
						While using SVG as image and inline SVG are pretty obvious and common, let me pay more attention to image font and object options.
					</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>Icon font</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							Begin with Icon fonts
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Icon fonts are typefaces that use images rather than letter forms.</li>
							<li>Like type, each character is scalable and can be modified using CSS.</li>
							<li>Icon fonts are transparent by nature so you can put them on any background and you can change the opacity of icons.</li>
							<li>The most popular library of icon fonts is <span class="brand-name">Font Awesome</span>. It’s used for more than 100 million websites and includes a robust collection of icons.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							- Icon fonts are practically fonts where letters a replaces with SVG icons.
							- And they share all characteristics of fonts such as size selection or positioning.
							- Icon letters are transparent, so you can apply any background.
							- The most popular and the first library of icon fonts is Font Awesome which was developed to be used in Bootstrap.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Cons of Using Icon Fonts</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>You can't apply gradient to it.</li>
							<li>You might not need a full icon set.</li>
							<li>Some screen readers don’t know what to do with icon fonts.</li>
							<li>You might not find a pack that has all icons you need.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							But there are some negative aspects in using Icon fonts.
							- you can't apply gradient to it.
							- you consume excessive memory if you don't need all icons of the this font.
							- some screen readers can not recognize it
							- it is possible that you don't find all icons you need in this pack.

						<h2>Object</h2>
						
						<aside class="notes">
							Let's have a look at insertion SVG as objects
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Using SVG as object gives pretty good control over animation and modification of SVG image. However there is a pitfall that you can't assign Event Listener to this object element.</p>
												
						<aside class="notes">
							As it was shown in the table before, objects provide pretty good control over modification and animation of SVG omage.
							Bad thing is that you can't assign event listener to this object which makes it more or less useless.
